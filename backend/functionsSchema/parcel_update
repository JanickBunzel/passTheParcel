Accepts PUT/PATCH(tbd) request with JSON body and updates the db
Some fields should be final for example, origin, destination, weight etc should not be changed so an error will be raised if any of these have new info

const supabaseUrl = 'https://joyhrjrniigcnbgvlrcl.supabase.co'

expected from http request body:
    {
  "id": UUID,
  "payment": "complete",
}
returns response code 200
