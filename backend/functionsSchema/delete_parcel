DELETE http request to delete parcel from db

expects parcel id as a path parameter in the URL

use FastAPI + Pydantic to validate parameters passed as JSON string in body are valid types
could also do this manually
  
URL:
"/parcels/delete_parcel/{parcel_id}")

  
{
  "id": UUID
}


Sidenote- need to consider how we authenticate users for our functions
